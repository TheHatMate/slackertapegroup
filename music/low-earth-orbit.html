                        The original Low Earth Orbit EP came out on Total Trash Tapes four years ago. I'm impatient for a 5-year anniversary 
                        remastered reissue. I made this EP in about two weeks in that summer and people occasionally still talk about it. 
                        I figured that I would make a reissue so people I can give people something instead of saying they have long since 
                        disappeared.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the sounds on this EP were the very first things I had ever actually put some level of effort into recording. 
                        I had developed an obsession with ambient music and synthesizers and that summer I got my hands on a Korg Monologue 
                        (honestly a pretty difficult machine to make ambient with, but I was determined). I did not know what I was doing. I 
                        did not know how to play keyboard. Yet I enjoyed the sounds that it made, especially continually layering the sounds over 
                        each other in ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know what artists I was copying with each song on this project. Each song is basically a love-letter to a musician's 
                        style I had worshipped at 19. Even listening to this again years later, I'm filled with a tempered proudness of the 
                        product of the music. I manage to actually enjoy something I made. It only took four years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This reissue I took the liberty of remastering some of the tracks somewhat. Many of them were mixed very quietly. 
                        Just some technical things to make the general listening experience less cumbersome.
