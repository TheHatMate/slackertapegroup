                    <p>
                        Hey everyone I'm excited to open submissions for the second edition of Taste of Edmononton. A very long overdue 
                        release. <a href="https://slackertapegroup.com/music/taste-of-edmonton-1.html">Taste of Edmonoton #1</a> was the first 
                        project released on the label and came out almost two years ago at this point. I've always wanted to do a second edition 
                        of this type of compilation. Last time I reached out to a bunch of people I knew in & around Edmonton to contribute because 
                        Slacker Tape Group didn't really exist back then. This time I'll be opening up to submissions and the guidelines will be a 
                        bit different compared to the structure presented on the first volume. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are interested in submitting to the next edition, please read the guidelines listed and send your submission!</p>
                    <u>Guidelines</u>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You must be an artist from the Edmonton area</li>
                        <li>You must submit original & unreleased music.

                                <li>If your song has been previously released as a single, album, EP, or any other collection of recording, 
                                    it will not be considered.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>Recording quality does not need to be excellent. We welcome lo-fi recordings as long as that is intentional.</li>

                            the tracklist. After release you can do as you please.

                    <b>NOTE: This label bleeds money alone through material costs, I can't guarantee payment to anyone unless a divine 
                        miracle occurs. So until then, I'll give you a copy of the tape when it's done instead.
