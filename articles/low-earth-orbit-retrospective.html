                <h2>Low Earth Orbit Retrospective</h2>
                <h3>by <i>pb</i></h3>
                <h4>17 September 2024</h4>
                <p>
                    The sign adorning the cover of the Low Earth Orbit EP sits in the field across from Servus 
                    Place on Campbell road in the tiny little conservative christian haven of St. Albert, Alberta. 
                    I, to this day, don’t understand the exact mythology crafted around this blank sign in a farmers 
                    field, or why the artist chose it to visually summarize the sum of the recordings. I know that 
                    me and Bruno used to bike there pretty frequently, sometimes joined by some friends and other 
                    times just the two of us. We met only a few months before this and hit it off very quickly. 
                    Bonded over music and movies, the only important things to a 19 and a 20 year old. I remember 
                    talking to Bruno about the minutiae of different synth waves, or lore dumping about my favourite 
                    bands. This was also the beginning of going to shows together. I speculate that two of these first 
                    concerts forever changed the trajectory of my friends life. First was GY!BE with Kevin Doria opening, 
                    it was a long drawn out ambient set followed by a long drawn out Post Rock set. I came up with this 
                    joke... How do you know you’re about to see a post rock band? the bassist is sitting in a chair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second was Pigeon Breeders with Ghost Cars. These non typical Alberta dudes played 
                    a set of improvised songs where one of the instruments was, and I shit you not, a cheese 
                    grater. We sat on the floor right in front of them, the barrier between performer and audience 
                    erased. After the set I noticed Bruno talking to the band; being a real gear geek. Learning. 
                    I could see in his eyes that he had some epiphany that night and as only a witness to this miracle 
                    I speculate it was something like this: “There is no barrier between what can and what can’t, you 
                    can go on a stage and do anything and it will blow minds”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He had a Pigeon Breeders poster hung up in his room; one of the only ones on his otherwise 
                    barren wall at that time. As if some kind of reminder of the miracle. Some people do this with 
                    crucifixes. From then on our friendship became about ambient music. We would try our hardest in 
                    an embarrassing young adult way to create something meaningful without saying much. We were going 
                    to be called Oceans of Solaris. OOS would play concerts for ourselves in my parents basement on days 
                    the house was empty. Hours at a time at the loudest volumes our gear could bellow. Fully sober (which 
                    might make the image more embarrassing). I think we both dreamt of being on a stage, joining and 
                    proving ourselves in the extremely inspiring local Edmonton ambient scene; equipment was bought, 
                    ideas were had and Alejandro Jodorwosky was on our minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The train was derailed. Lockdown. Out the door with these dreams. In the early months 
                    of the pandemic out of a combination of boredom and wanting to be heard I schemed up 
                    starting my own record label, Total Trash Tapes. I offered Bruno the maiden release 
                    (admittedly out of self doubt for my own songs, a similar thing happened at a show we played 
                    in vancouver) and he gladly accepted. Thus began the process. The songs were recorded, the 
                    tapes were ordered, I learned about cassette assembly and out came the Low Earth Orbit EP. 
                    When I first heard the songs I felt proud of my friend. He crafted these beautiful, full 
                    sounding songs out of seemingly nowhere in seemingly no time at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A favourite instantly and likely for the rest of my life is It Smells Like Dust And Moonlight, 
                    for it is so tender. Droning synthesizers develop their own meaning to the listener but 
                    for me the meaning I derive from these drones is beyond my own will. Naturally the meaning 
                    of that song will always be about the intimacy of friendship, laughing over penis jokes, 
                    meeting up at airports, record shopping, talking about our respective heritages. Maybe its 
                    no coincidence that the sign on the album cover happens to be on the other side of a long field 
                    that I used to stare at from my childhood home; I leave the vastness of childhood and on the 
                    other side I find a literal sign of my friend. Total Trash Tapes is no more and only existed 
                    for a few months but I’m so happy that maybe in someway the torch was passed down. Many years 
                    later the songs still mean something to people, people are still drawn to the amateurish ambient 
                    dude from the northern most big city in the country. Low Earth Orbit & Slacker Tape group forever. 
                    Release it forever I say, the people need to hear it all around the world.
