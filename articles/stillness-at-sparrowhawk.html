                <h2>Stillness at Sparrowhawk</h2>
                <h3>by <i>Bruno Grossi</i></h3>
                <h4>Aug 16, 2024</h4>
                <p>     I felt like I had discovered the taste of tranquility there. Sparrowhawk at Spray Lake. I can picture the image of the 
                    moment in my mind, where the sudden chill and pass of the feeling left its calling card. Staring out at the view of 
                    the nature surrounding Sparrowhawk at Spray Lake.
                </p>
                <p>     It was the missing movement of the breeze, the stalled air above the hill we stood on was cool. Little weeds 
                    grew in-between the rocky surface, sprouting their leaves out the silty gray pastiche, curving downwards to 
                    the rocky shore. I saw the lone fisherman, small and still, staring out, his rod as unmoving as he was, 
                    imitating the waters he grazed. Spray Lake expanded like a mirror to the sky. A reflection so perfect the glare 
                    would stare back at you for watching too long. The lake continued to extend in subtle curves around the peninsulas 
                    of avalanche that slipped into the edges. The mountains would dip their toes in this way. Crawling just a little 
                    further in during the sweltering summer, they’d ease back in the relief of the glacial water. The trousers of 
                    deep green hiking up their sides, thinning out to expose the defining stone, carved sharp, the couture of 
                    shadows curtain across the side of their faces. The pockets of darkness littering Goat Mountain look like 
                    soft craters, refuge from the blistering July heat. The white hot sun is relentless and pours through the 
                    patchwork of leaves, the blips of dimmed light are scattered along the path leading down the hill from the 
                    forest. I watched the forest from the other side, imagining this same littering of light through the flora appearing 
                    all around at a moment like this.
                </p>
                <p>     My uncle crouched at the rocky shore down the north face of the hill we stood on. He’d taken his 
                    shoes off to step in the water. Like the mountains, he too eased his body with the coldness of the water surrounding 
                    him. I watched him slip into this peace through the growth of the brush. He dropped his hands into the blue, 
                    submerging his fingers and then submitting his wrists after a moment of breath. A pulse of waves extended from 
                    the stem where he laid his arms. I watched it extend to the white shoreline, curving north like a lazy goose. 
                    The shoreline turned sharp, disappearing behind itself, and my gaze was left with the blue fabric of the water again. 
                    Continuously crawling on and on until it met the seam of the next shore further down and exploding into the monumentally 
                    consuming body of the mountain. All covered again with the deep forest and textured shale and silt where it once gave 
                    out, spilling itself into Spray Lake, giving it another curve, another shore. My vision returns to my uncle, still 
                    dipping his arms into the lake’s glacial refuge, breathing out slowly the summer heat, appearing only as a dot next 
                    to the immensity of the unmoving landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                        It is these captured moments of nigh unmoving scenery at Sparrowhawk that are granted the title of Ideal. 
                    Scanning this landscape, not merely investigating, but admiring the subtleties of the flora and 
                    endless ridges seemingly sealed in time finally delivered the pang of true natural tranquility 
                    to my heart. Even though there was movement - the insects that buzz and bite around me and under 
                    the dirt I stand, the myriad of animals hidden among the trees along the shores and the unknown 
                    invisible beings living in the waters of Spray Lake - the feeling I was placed into a painted scenery 
                    was unpassable. Time had caught up to the sensation and arrived at serenity. Nothing that wasn’t quiet 
                    dripped away to silence. I became static like the world, simply becoming part of it. I could see the 
                    fisherman, still just as he was, and my uncle too, both so distant, and still matching the part. 
                    I felt my heart’s suspension from its strings slowly unravel while my eyes followed the line of 
                    the sky and the stone. It unwrapped and spun in my body, freefalling past my organs and landing 
                    in the bottom of something. Tears began to well, blurring my vision of the beauty bestowed. My 
                    face contorted into nothing, only the tears summoned any courage in the moment to break the stillness, 
                    leaving a salty trail down the curve of my face, before falling to the dusty ground and evaporating 
                    in an instant on the stones. The peace of the moment was not disturbed by this and so the tears continued 
                    to follow the path set out. Just as the mountains carved out a trail for the winter’s snow to fill the 
                    basin, these tears too followed a familiar path. So suddenly my muscles froze and my eyes were drowned 
                    in the full beauty of the land before me.
                </p>

                <p>
                        Hours later, sitting at an overcrowded restaurant table, the heat of the long day slowly baking 
                    my brain through the oven of my skull, I stared dismayed at the food. Though I had ordered what 
                    had sounded good to me, a dish I cannot even remember the name of now, my body feigned fullness 
                    at the seemingly hostile air. The atmosphere breathed loudly. Innumerable voices, agreeing that 
                    “absolutely, we saw some very beautiful places today”. A sentiment that seemed to bounce back and 
                    forth in a volley. Unbelievable buzz happening all around me that was a spinning string, swinging 
                    around my neck, graceful pressure that built and built to a rope’s suffocation.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I got up in a way that felt like that rope had yanked on me. The vacant bathroom offered a short respite. 
                    Sitting there in the private stall, eyes fixed on the bottom of the door handle, listening to the 
                    low rumble of patronage and footsteps upstairs, I began to see the shadows of the mountains at 
                    Sparrowhawk in the floats of my vision. The unmoving reflections of Spray Lake just beneath came 
                    back to me. I focused my thoughts on the stillness at Sparrowhawk, everything restful and away from 
                    this place. Staring at what was actually the corner of the bathroom floor, I felt the soft breeze and 
                    watched how the low branches swayed like a slow ballet. Their moving shadows that would bring and take 
                    the warmth of the sun with their rhythm. I felt like I could still turn to look down the hill and see my 
                    uncle with his hands in the cold of the water. Waving his wrists just below the surface to cool down 
                    from the day’s heat. His shoes are sitting on the shale leading to the lake. The day is so clear the 
                    water was a reflection of the sky. So the curtain of quiet enraptured me and I heard nothing of the 
                    chaos and panic I had escaped. Instead, I started out as far as I could, to where the lake begins to 
                    curve behind the mountains. All I thought was for when I could return there.
