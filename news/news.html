                <p>This album took a while for me to publish, but I'm very happy it is finally out for everyone to listen to, I've been enjoying 
                    listening to it while I put them together so it's good for it to finally be out now! Find it at 
                    Blackbyrd Muisc and Listen Records in the next week locally or if you are outside of the city place an order on the bandcamp!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stay tuned for more tapes coming out this summer. The next two will likely come out at the same time and they will be big ones!

                <p>Things here have been a little quiet again, but that does not cease the development of new tapes, and there are plenty to

                <p>This summer will see a handful of new cassettes that I am very excited to release.</p>

                <u>Taste of Edmonton #2</u>
                <p>Submissions for Taste of Edmonton #2 have been closed for a while now. I haven't had the time I desired to select all 
                    the songs for submissions yet, but if you submitted, expect in the next few weeks to recieve an email about your song! 
                    What I have heard so far has me really excited about the songs for this compilation. Stay up to date on that for news!</p>
                <u>Interview</u>
                <p>I had the opportunity to do an interview yesterday about what I do here at Slacker Tape Group, answering some questions 
                    relating to what it is like running a small record label, what I do and so on and so forth. Check it out on youtube in the 
                    link below. Thanks to Moustafa for the interview!</p>

                <p>This is a lot but I'm excited about the future of what I am doing right now, so there will be a bustle of activity here in the next few weeks I think. Thanks everyone!</p>

                <h3>RISLING! - KLEINKRIEG streaming release + Taste of Edmonton #2 Deadline extension</h3>
                <h5>10 January 2025</h5>
                <p>Good Morning folks,</p>
                <p>
                    First things first, RISLING's new album "KLEINKRIEG" has just released on streaming this morning. It's a fantastic album 
                    that will eventually be getting a physical release in the future here on Slacker Tapes. For now, go give it a listen on 
                    streaming! 
                </p>
                <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1jnC3VYy6au25Hz61x9el0?utm_source=generator"

                <p>
                    You'll probably have noticed Slacker hasn't done much these last days few days here. Truth is that life is BUSY and this 
                    can only get so much attention, but I really do love doing all the tape label stuff. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though as a result the schedules have been shuffled around quite a bit and Taste of Edmonton #2 will be getting done 
                    later than anticipated. 
                </p>
                <b>
                    The good news is that I will be extending the deadline for submissions until March 1st 2025!! 
                </b>
                <p>
                    I've really enjoyed the submissions I've gotten so far, the local music scene here is so cool and good, 
                    I'll be reaching out to each submission soon to let you know! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are at all considering on submitting, take this as your call to action to send in your 
                    music!! All guidelines remain the same and are 
                    <a href="https://slackertapegroup.com/music/taste-of-edmonton-2.html">on the website still.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's it for now, thanks for the patience everyone.
