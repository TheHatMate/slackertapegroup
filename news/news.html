                <h3>RISLING! - KLEINKRIEG streaming release + Taste of Edmonton #2 Deadline extension</h3>
                <h5>10 January 2025</h5>
                <p>Good Morning folks,</p>
                <p>
                    First things first, RISLING's new album "KLEINKRIEG" has just released on streaming this morning. It's a fantastic album 
                    that will eventually be getting a physical release in the future here on Slacker Tapes. For now, go give it a listen on 
                    streaming! 
                </p>
                <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1jnC3VYy6au25Hz61x9el0?utm_source=generator"

                <p>
                    You'll probably have noticed Slacker hasn't done much these last days few days here. Truth is that life is BUSY and this 
                    can only get so much attention, but I really do love doing all the tape label stuff. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though as a result the schedules have been shuffled around quite a bit and Taste of Edmonton #2 will be getting done 
                    later than anticipated. 
                </p>
                <b>
                    The good news is that I will be extending the deadline for submissions until March 1st 2025!! 
                </b>
                <p>
                    I've really enjoyed the submissions I've gotten so far, the local music scene here is so cool and good, 
                    I'll be reaching out to each submission soon to let you know! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are at all considering on submitting, take this as your call to action to send in your 
                    music!! All guidelines remain the same and are 
                    <a href="https://slackertapegroup.com/music/taste-of-edmonton-2.html">on the website still.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's it for now, thanks for the patience everyone.

                <h5>8 October 2024</h5>
                <p>Good Morning folks,</p>
                <p>
                    I per usual suffer froms some silence on here occasionally. Been putting in a lot of work with new tapes that 
                    I've lost a bit of steam, but that is not to say anything is slowing down at all. We've got at least one tape releasing this 
                    month so stay tuned into that!
                </p>
                <p>
                    About two weeks ago we released a limited edition tape issue of Edmonoton's BAD HAM's new album Crosswalk! The release 
                    show was a lot of fun and they killed that shit. Take a look, read about it, order a tape from them. In classic Slacker 
                    fashion, there are only 25 floating here and there.

                    It is a bit difficult to keep this as consistent as I would like when life's commitments get in the way, but this label 
                    has been so much fun to operate, especially over the last year. I've never felt so happy to be in the Edmonton music scene. 
                    So many talented bands and individuals out there and I just wanna make tapes for fucking everyone its actually such a blessing 
                    to be in a city where people are excited to have their music physically manifest. Might end up doing this forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://slackertapegroup.com/music/taste-of-edmonton-2.html">Taste of Edmonton #2</a> submissions are STILL OPEN. If 
                    you want a chance to get a single song or anything on tape by next spring, this is your chance! I'm serious, submit anything. 
                    Take advantage of the fact that I am super excited about everything right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is nothing else to really post about right now, but an update here or there is better than none whatsoever. Consider this

                <h3>Low Earth Orbit EP Reissue</h3>
                <h5>17 September 2024</h5>
                <p>Hello people,</p>
                <p>
                    Today is release day once again. This time it is the Low Earth Orbit EP from 2020 that has been remastered. 
                    I've been thinking about doing a re-issue of this ever since I started the label and I felt like time enough has passed. 
                    Could have certainly waited for 5-year anniversary, but fuck that. Check out more information about it by clicking below!

                    Along with the reissue is a write-up retrospective by a good friend of mine whom helped inspire much of what I do today. 
                    Click below to give it a read. I highly encourage it. Gives some context to the project and how life was at that time and 
                    it just makes me happy people still think of this.

                    Keeps eyes and ears out for it on Instagram. Very excited about that one.

                <p>Hello folks.</p>
                <p>Today is the release day for the live Sleeve of Skin album. I'm really pleased with how it has turned out.
                    Find the links and more information about it <a href="https://slackertapegroup.com/music/sleeve-of-skin-live-at-aviary.html">here!</a>

                </div>
                <p>It's worth mentioning as well that there are at least five more projects being released on the label before the end of the year. 
                    Keep an eye on the Instagram, here and the Bandcamp as I will be posting and updating more frequently, especially since the speed
                    at which these releases will be happening will be quite a bit more accelerated.
                </p>
                <p>Next thing to mention is the Sketches of Bruderheim tapes are now available on the bandcamp 
                    <a href="https://slackertapegroup.bandcamp.com/album/sketches-of-bruderheim">here!</a> Entirely my fault and lack of discipline
                    to actually get it done. As of writing there are about 15 copies left over so if you would like one, get on that train!
                </p>
                <p>I will forever continue to mention that if you would like to see your music on cassette and in the Edmonton area, please send stuff! 
                    I've never been so energized (and had enough money to fund) to work on new projects. So if you have something cool and want to see 
                    it physically manifest, send it to me and I just might do it :)

                <p>Hello folks.</p>
                <p>Maintaining a website is actually a lot harder than I ever thought, but I am back to focusing on it.</p>
                <p>There are many announcements for now that I hope to make a more consistent and 
                    regular occurrence so I do not dump a billion things down all at once.</p>
                <p>First, RISLING! & Low Earth Orbit’s Sketches of Bruderheim is now out! It’s 
                    been on streaming for a bit and tapes are available to be purchased. They’ve already been 
                    going so if you want one make an order!</p>
                <p>Second, Sleeve of Skin left the basement and performed at the aviary. Thanks for coming to 
                    that show if you did. If you didn’t, now you need to book us.</p>
                <p>Third, many blank tapes have happened upon the Slacker House doorstep so expect new 
                    recordings to be available very soon on cassettes. We might also have some CDs, but I didn’t 
                    tell you that. Expect the Sleeve of Skin live performance to be released soon.</p>
                <p>Fourth, I’m working on expanding the website a bit more so if you are an

                <p>Hey folks,</p>
                <p>On March 26th a band called Holy Family will play Noisecafe at the Aviary. This is a group formed of the artists

                    and especially excited about the other artists too. Make sure to come out for it. Weather should be good so we accept
                    no excuses. Check the below poster for more details! Make sure to
