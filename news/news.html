                <h3>Sleeve of Skin Live @ The Aviary Release + More</h3>
                <h5>4 September 2024</h5>
                <p>Hello folks.</p>
                <p>Today is the release day for the live Sleeve of Skin album. I'm really pleased with how it has turned out.
                    Find the links and more information about it <a href="https://slackertapegroup.com/music/sleeve-of-skin-live-at-aviary.html">here!</a> 
                </p>
                <div class="album">
                    <a href="https://slackertapegroup.com/music/sleeve-of-skin-live-at-aviary.html"><img src="https://slackertapegroup.com/img/albums/slack10.jpg"><br>

                    <i class="catnum">SLACK10</i>
                </div>
                <p>It's worth mentioning as well that there are at least five more projects being released on the label before the end of the year. 
                    Keep an eye on the Instagram, here and the Bandcamp as I will be posting and updating more frequently, especially since the speed
                    at which these releases will be happening will be quite a bit more accelerated.
                </p>
                <p>Next thing to mention is the Sketches of Bruderheim tapes are now available on the bandcamp 
                    <a href="https://slackertapegroup.bandcamp.com/album/sketches-of-bruderheim">here!</a> Entirely my fault and lack of discipline
                    to actually get it done. As of writing there are about 15 copies left over so if you would like one, get on that train!
                </p>
                <p>I will forever continue to mention that if you would like to see your music on cassette and in the Edmonton area, please send stuff! 
                    I've never been so energized (and had enough money to fund) to work on new projects. So if you have something cool and want to see 
                    it physically manifest, send it to me and I just might do it :)

                <h3>August Updates</h3>
                <h5>2 August 2024</h5>
                <p>Hello folks.</p>
                <p>Maintaining a website is actually a lot harder than I ever thought, but I am back to focusing on it.</p>
                <p>There are many announcements for now that I hope to make a more consistent and 
                    regular occurrence so I do not dump a billion things down all at once.</p>
                <p>First, RISLING! & Low Earth Orbit’s Sketches of Bruderheim is now out! It’s 
                    been on streaming for a bit and tapes are available to be purchased. They’ve already been 
                    going so if you want one make an order!</p>
                <p>Second, Sleeve of Skin left the basement and performed at the aviary. Thanks for coming to 
                    that show if you did. If you didn’t, now you need to book us.</p>
                <p>Third, many blank tapes have happened upon the Slacker House doorstep so expect new 
                    recordings to be available very soon on cassettes. We might also have some CDs, but I didn’t 
                    tell you that. Expect the Sleeve of Skin live performance to be released soon.</p>
                <p>Fourth, I’m working on expanding the website a bit more so if you are an 
                    Edmonton-based artist/writer/photographer/whatever, use the contact page to get your shit published online!</p>
                <p>That’s it for now, thanks everybody for holding in.</p>
