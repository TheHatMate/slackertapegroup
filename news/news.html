                <h3>August Updates</h3>
                <h5>Aug 2, 2024</h5>
                <p>Hello folks.</p>
                <p>Maintaining a website is actually a lot harder than I ever thought, but I am back to focusing on it.</p>
                <p>There are many announcements for now that I hope to make a more consistent and 
                    regular occurrence so I do not dump a billion things down all at once.</p>
                <p>First, RISLING! & Low Earth Orbit’s Sketches of Bruderheim is now out! It’s 
                    been on streaming for a bit and tapes are available to be purchased. They’ve already been 
                    going so if you want one make an order!</p>
                <p>Second, Sleeve of Skin left the basement and performed at the aviary. Thanks for coming to 
                    that show if you did. If you didn’t, now you need to book us.</p>
                <p>Third, many blank tapes have happened upon the Slacker House doorstep so expect new 
                    recordings to be available very soon on cassettes. We might also have some CDs, but I didn’t 
                    tell you that. Expect the Sleeve of Skin live performance to be released soon.</p>
                <p>Fourth, I’m working on expanding the website a bit more so if you are an 
                    Edmonton-based artist/writer/photographer/whatever, use the contact page to get your shit published online!</p>
                <p>That’s it for now, thanks everybody for holding in.</p>

                <p>Hey folks,</p>
                <p>On March 26th a band called Holy Family will play Noisecafe at the Aviary. This is a group formed of the artists
                    behind Low Earth Orbit, Electric Bench Hoop and ProV1der (aka Bruno, Eli & Jackson). We are looking forward to playing our set
                    and especially excited about the other artists too. Make sure to come out for it. Weather should be good so we accept
                    no excuses. Check the below poster for more details! Make sure to
